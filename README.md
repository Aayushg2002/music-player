###Architecture Overview:

-Micro Frontend Implementation
  The application uses Webpack Module Federation to implement the micro frontend architecture:
     1.Container App:
         -Acts as the host application
         -Dynamically loads the Music Library micro frontend
         -Manages authentication state via React Context
         -Provides the auth context to the micro frontend
     2.Music Library (Micro Frontend):
         -Exposes its components via Module Federation
         -Receives auth props from the container
         -Contains all music library functionality
         -Has no direct authentication logic
         
-Role-Based Authentication
  The authentication system works as follows:
    1.Mock JWT:
         -Tokens are stored in localStorage
         -Contains user role information
         -No actual backend validation (purely frontend mock)
    2.Role Handling:
         -Admin role sees all CRUD operations
         -User role only sees read-only views
         -UI elements are shown/hidden based on roles
    3.Protected Routes:
         -Unauthenticated users are redirected to login
         -Role-specific routes are enforced

 -Built With:
     React 18
     Vite
     Webpack Module Federation
     Tailwind CSS
     React Router
     JWT (mock implementation)
